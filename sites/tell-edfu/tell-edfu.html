     <h3>Regional and Geographic Setting</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Tell Edfu is located in Upper Egypt on the western banks of the Nile River, halfway between Aswan and Luxor. The entire site spans about six hectares with the tell a few meters west of the Ptolemaic Temple and 5 kilometers to the north of a small step pyramid, north of the village el-Ghonameya (1). The tell itself is a mound formed from the continuous buildup of settlements over centuries of civilization. This mound may have originally been a sandstone island formation with a cliff on its eastern edge, confining the entire occupation of the site to the tell, due to the Nile floods that affected the lower-lying areas (2).  By the time the tell was abandoned in the 10th century AD, the mound rose to about 20 to 25 meters above the Ptolemaic Temple (3). In present day, due to sebakh digging, the tell to the west of the temple is 10 to 15 meters high and extends 365 meters north to south and 168 meters east and west (3). The archaeological site over time, has been encroached upon by modern buildings and some ancient remains to the east of the temple are located under modern buildings and cannot be excavated. The geological composition of the site consists primarily of a natural sandstone bedrock formation with several layers of sand and clay (4). The area also included sebakh, rich soil, that was dug out and used by the local peoples, millennia later, as a fertilizer for agriculture (4). This type of digging has affected archaeological finds and destroys the stratigraphy of the site. </p>

 <h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The site of Tell Edfu is mostly characterized by the old Ptolemaic temple built during the reign of Ptolemy III on its eastern side (4). The tell itself occupies a large amount of space to the west of the temple and the remains of the eastern tell is buried under the architecture of modern buildings and homes in modern Edfu. Although the temple, dedicated to Horus, is a more attractive and beautifully designed piece of architecture, this mound of sand and soil can give an archaeologist a lot more information about the inner workings of Ancient Egypt.

In the northern area of the tell lie traces of enclosure walls from the First Intermediate Period. These walls mark the northern limits of the site and show traces of settlements from the early Middle Kingdom. This area is labeled by Nadine Moeller and her team at the University of Chicago as “Zone 3” (4).

On the eastern part of the tell, directly beside the Ptolemaic Temple is “Zone 2” which consists of Old Kingdom settlement remains as well as more enclosure walls (5). Next to the Mammisi built during the reign of Ptolemy VIII and Euergetus II is “Zone 1” which consists of a silo courtyard built atop an abandoned columned hall (4). This courtyard contains 18 silos that belonged to a large granary court which acted as the primary grain reserve of the ancient town during the Second Intermediate Period (3). Before the silos were constructed, a large columned hall, containing 16 columns, housed the administrative complex of Edfu during the Middle Kingdom (3). When this hall fell out of use, the columns were torn down but some of the bases can still be seen under the excavated silo court.

Five kilometers to the south of the Tell Edfu site lies a small step pyramid. This pyramid is located near a modern cemetery as well as an access road that leads to a highway linking Cairo and Aswan (1). This has endangered the site and preservation of the pyramid has been furthered by members of the Tell Edfu Project.
