		 <p>Amenhotep III, son of Tuthmosis IV, was the ninth king of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. He was known as the Pharaoh who brought “prosperity and peace.” He bought upon political stability and devoted his time to the arts in Egypt. Under his reign, he’s constructed many of the most phenomenal structures of ancient Egypt and with help of his military, he was able to extend and strengthen their borders. He completely transformed the landscape of the Nile River. When Amenhotep III was twelve years old, he married Tiye and came to the throne. Once Amenhotep III was older and able to make decisions, he really succeeded in having high approval ratings. He was coined the term “Master of Diplomacy,” due to his “debt through lavish gifts of gold so that they would be inclined to bend to his wishes…” According to researchers, Amenhotep III was considered probably the richest man in the world. During the imperial age, gold flowed into Egypt more than out. Foreign rulers look towards Amenhotep III for gold. They pleaded for it to help change the landscape in their own country.</p>

     <p>In 1353 BCE, Pharaoh Amenhotep III died from health complications. His ruling lasted about 40 years alongside his wife, Queen Tiye. He established many great relations with nations around. It was said that they wrote letters once he passed away stating that they will continue to bond with Egypt even though Amenhotep III is gone. His son, Amenhotep IV, succeeded his father and continued follow his father’s steps until he made some changes during his fifth year. Egypt fell under the reign of Amenhotep IV. After his passing, Horemheb took over and tried his best to restore Egypt to the days when Amenhotep III ruled, however it didn’t manage to reach those heights again. Amenhotep III went down to be the “luxurious pharaoh, diplomat, hunter, warrior, and great architect of Egyptian monuments.</p>

     <h3>INTRODUCTION TO SITE</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>Pharaoh Amenhotep III’s legacy was recognized in a mortuary temple made for rituals and infinite offerings to honor the Pharaoh after his passing. As many know, Amenhotep III did not build small structures. His architectures were jaw-dropping and mesmerizing. Of course, his temple had to relate to something he would’ve done. The mortuary temple was constructed near his tomb and was considered “the grandest of all mortuary temple complexes built in Egypt.” The mortuary temple began construction in the city of Luxor along the Nile River. It included “three massive mud-brick pylons, or gats, aligned on a single axis, and a long connecting corridor leading to an immense, open solar courtyard, a roofed hall, a sanctuary, and sacred alter.” The whole structure contained hundreds of statues, sphinxes, and slabs that contained Amenhotep III’s legacy. At the entrance of the mortuary temple, the Colossi of Memnon stands tall and a long corridor with the “gates”, which leads to the Sun court. The Sun court was divided into two different halves, North and South. Both sides contained statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and other gods. The temple itself is gigantic. It measured 328 feet wide by 1,968 feet in length.</p>

 <p>After a major earthquake, the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III was destroyed. It was dated to happen around 1200 BC. Roman authorities decided to come in and reconstruct some of it, but there was another earthquake in 27 BC that ruined it again. Currently, the only thing that stands are the Colossi of Memnon. It depicts Amenhotep III sitting down with his hands on his knees, gazing across the Nile. These statues were made from quartzite sandstone and transported overland to Luxor. They reach 60 feet in height and it weighs almost 720 tons. The statues are almost unrecognizable now, but they are remembered as the guardians of the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III. This grand temple was envied by other pharaohs. The Temple of Karanak was also being built during this time and it was smaller. No one was able to compete.</p>
